# MIDRC – Building and Using AI-Ready Datasets from a Massive Open Data Commons 

## Session Date & Time
Tuesday, November 28 from 10:30 - 11:30am

This session, led by principal investigators of MIDRC will give an overview of the structure of the MIDRC data commons and a tour of the open access data portal published on the Gen3 platform. During this session, attendees will have the opportunity to experience how to build a selected data cohort direct from the MIDRC data commons for AI research.

## Abstract
The Medical Imaging Data and Resource Center (MIDRC; midrc.org) is a multi-institutional effort led by the AAPM, ACR and RSNA and funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) to collect and publish imaging and related clinical data to support research into uses of AI for assessment and treatment of COVID-19, including long COVID. MIDRC has aggregated hundreds of thousands of imaging studies of COVID-19 patients and control cases with similar imaging protocols. MIDRC provides an infrastructure for collecting and publishing data to support research that can be applied across all areas of medical imaging. This session, attendees will learn how to build cohorts and download data, learn about MIDRC’s interoperability, and walk through MIDRC’s resources available to help medical imaging AI researchers.
 
## Key Learning Objectives
Become familiar with MIDRC, including how to contribute and how to use its open medical imaging data.
