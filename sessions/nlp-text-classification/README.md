## Pre-Course Instructions
Thanks for registering for our session! For the best educational experience, you must bring your own **laptop computer**. This session will be run using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), which does not work as well on tablet or smartphone devices. You will also need a Google account (even if temporary) to access Colab.

Ahead of the session, we ask that you take time to review the notebooks from prior years' sessions provided in this folder: `RSNA21_RNNs-with-Tensorboard.ipynb` and `RSNA22_NLP_Transformers.ipynb`. 
1. Simply click on the file in the menu above to launch the file preview.
2. Then click the `Open in Colab` link at the top of the notebook to launch it in Colab.

The session will begin with a brief didactic session covering some basic concepts in deep learning for **natural language processing (NLP)**, using examples from the notebooks from prior years. 

Feel free to preview the other notebooks, as well. They will be the focus of the interactive component of our session.

We look forward to seeing you in Chicago!
